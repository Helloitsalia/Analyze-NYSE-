# 📊 Analyze NYSE Data - Business Analytics Project

This project is part of my Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree and focuses on analyzing NYSE (New York Stock Exchange) data to uncover key financial insights across industries and companies.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using Excel and SQL, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of company financials from the NYSE dataset. The key objectives of this project were:

- To identify trends in revenue, margins, and profitability.
- To build scenario-based financial forecasts.
- To create dynamic dashboards for clear, interactive insights.

## 🧩 Key Tasks

### Task 1: Summary Statistics
- Calculated average revenue growth, gross margin, and operating margin by year and sector.
- Presented data with professional formatting and clean visuals.

### Task 2: Profit and Loss Dashboard
- Built a dynamic P&L statement using dropdown selectors for companies.
- Enabled users to view financials over time with a clean, user-friendly layout.

### Task 3: Forecasting Dashboard
- Created forecast scenarios (Strong, Base, Weak) with assumptions.
- Implemented Excel formulas (OFFSET, INDEX, MATCH) for automation.
- Visualized forecasts using clear bar and line charts.
